# 42 Piscine Experience

The 42 Piscine is an intense, month-long coding bootcamp designed to test your programming skills, perseverance, and ability to work under pressure. During my Piscine journey, I completed all exercises and projects from **C01** to **C07**, achieving the following scores:

- **C01**: 70%
- **C02**: 55%
- **C03**: 75%
- **C04**: 70%
- **C05**: 80%
- **C06**: 100%
- **C07**: 60%

Below is an overview of each module, what it entails, and some tips to succeed.

## Module Overviews

### C01: Basics of Programming
This module introduces fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, and basic functions.
- **Challenges**: Understanding syntax and logic.
- **Advice**: Pay close attention to coding standards and avoid hardcoding solutions. Practice debugging frequently.

### C02: Functions and Memory
This module focuses on creating reusable functions and handling pointers.
- **Challenges**: Managing pointers and understanding function prototypes.
- **Advice**: Draw diagrams to visualize memory and pointer behavior. Don't hesitate to test small snippets before integrating them into your main code.

### C03: Strings and Manipulation
This module covers working with strings, including basic manipulation and conversions.
- **Challenges**: Writing clean and efficient code for string operations.
- **Advice**: Memorize standard string functions and learn how to implement them manually.

### C04: You got it bro, it`s just kinda the same like previous one

### C05: Recursion and Mathematics
This module introduces recursion and basic mathematical operations.
- **Challenges**: Structuring recursive functions correctly.
- **Advice**: Start with base cases and build upward. Test with both small and large inputs to ensure correctness.

### C06: Working with arguments
This module involves working with command-line arguments (int argc, char **argv) and handling user input via the terminal.
- **Challenges**: Parsing and validating command-line arguments.
- **Advice**: Pay close attention to edge cases like missing or extra arguments. Practice writing code that gracefully handles incorrect input.

### C07: Advanced Memory Management
This module delves deeper into memory allocation and the basics of dynamic memory with `malloc` and `free`.
- **Challenges**: Understanding memory leaks and proper cleanup.
- **Advice**: Use tools like `valgrind` to identify memory issues and focus on handling edge cases.

## General Tips for the Piscine
- **Time Management**: Allocate time wisely between exercises and rest. The Piscine is a marathon, not a sprint.
- **Collaborate**: Discuss problems with peers, but ensure you understand the solutions yourself.
- **Learn to Debug**: Mastering `gdb`, print statements, and understanding error messages will save you a lot of time.
- **Stay Organized**: Keep your code neat and well-documented. This helps during evaluations.

## Good Luck!
The Piscine is a challenging but rewarding journey. Remember to stay persistent, ask for help when needed, and celebrate your progress. Best of luck to everyone embarking on their Piscine adventure!
